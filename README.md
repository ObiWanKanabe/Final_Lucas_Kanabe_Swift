# Down & Up GDD

**Lucas Kanabe**

## High Concept:
Down and up is a side-scrolling platformer. The player has to reach the end of the level while avoding spikes throughout the map. If the player hits a spike, the whole level is restarted.  The player is automatically running in the map, but obstacles are also in the way of the player, pushing them back off the left side of the screen, where the level is restarted as well. The only mechanics available to the player involves changing gravity and moving forward, but spikes and obstacles are on both the bottom and top of the map. Once the player reaches the end of the level, the game is won.
